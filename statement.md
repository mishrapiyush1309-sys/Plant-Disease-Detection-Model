## Problem Statement

Plant diseases cause significant crop loss, and many farmers struggle to identify them early.  
Manual inspection is slow, requires expertise, and is often inaccurate.  
This project aims to build an AI-based system that detects plant diseases from leaf images  
using a deep learning model.

## Scope of the Project

The project includes:
- Dataset preprocessing  
- CNN-based model creation  
- Training and validation  
- Performance evaluation  
- Visualization using accuracy & loss graphs  
- Disease prediction using an input leaf image  

The system can be extended into a mobile or web application.

## High-Level Features

- Automatic plant disease detection  
- Preprocessing (resize/normalize/augment images)  
- CNN-based classification  
- Support for 38 classes from PlantVillage dataset  
- Confusion matrix and prediction results
