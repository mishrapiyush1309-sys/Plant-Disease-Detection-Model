# Plant-Disease-Detection-Model
A Deep Learning Model to help farmers to detect the plant diseases
\# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning



This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images.  

It is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and helps identify diseases quickly and accurately.

\## 📘 Project Overview



Plant diseases can reduce agricultural productivity and are difficult to identify manually.  

This project uses deep learning to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories,  

helping farmers and researchers detect issues early.
